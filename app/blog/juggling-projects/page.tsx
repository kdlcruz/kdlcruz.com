            About a Year Into My First Job: The Start of Side Projects
          </h2>
          <p>
            About a year into my first job, I dove into the world of side
            projects. My first gig? A modest $4 an hour. It wasn’t about the
            money; it was about the learning. Each task was a stepping stone
            toward something bigger—a brighter opportunity in the future. At the
            time, burnout wasn’t on my radar. I was fueled by the thrill of
            growth and the belief that every ounce of effort would pay off down
            the line.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            My routine was intense. I’d leave work early, dive headfirst into
            side project tasks, sleep maybe four hours, and repeat. Weekends?
            Full-on grind mode. But I didn’t mind. I told myself, I’m a grinder,
            not the smartest, but relentless effort will set me apart.

            The Pros of Juggling Multiple Projects
          </h2>
          <p>
            There’s no denying the perks of taking on more than one project at a
            time:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 mb-4">
            <li>Extra income: Even small gigs add up over time.</li>

            The Hidden Costs
          </h2>
          <p>
            But here’s the catch: this lifestyle isn’t all sunshine and
            rainbows. The downsides are real, and they can creep up on you:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 mb-4">
            <li>
              Shallow learning: You learn the basics, but rarely have time to
              dive deep.
            </li>
            <li>
              Burnout risk: Physical and mental exhaustion is inevitable if you
              keep pushing for too long.
            </li>
            <li>
              Declining work quality: Spreading yourself thin can lead to
              mistakes or lackluster results.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sacrificed personal life: Long hours mean less time for family,
              friends, or even yourself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Focus struggles: Constantly switching gears between projects
              drains your mental energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Missed opportunities for mastery: You risk becoming a jack of all
              trades, master of none.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At one point, I hit my limit. Exhaustion set in, and I realized I
            wasn’t performing at my best. I had to make a tough call: drop one
            of my side projects. Ironically, it was my highest-paying client. I
            promised to return in a month after clearing my plate. That “month”
            turned into six. Once I wrapped up my commitments, I hit pause, took
            a breather, and let myself enjoy the downtime.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary-500">
            What I Learned and How I Work Now
          </h2>
          <p>
            Today, I still seek out side projects, but with a major difference:
            I cap it at one project at a time. Experience remains my greatest
            teacher, and I never stop learning. Even when I’m between projects,
            I dive into personal initiatives—testing out new frameworks,
            exploring emerging techniques, and sharpening my skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because in this industry, the moment you stop learning is the moment
            you stop growing.
          </p>

            Final Thoughts
          </h2>
          <p>
            Juggling multiple projects can be rewarding, but it comes with its
            share of risks. Know your limits, prioritize what matters, and make
            sure the grind doesn’t overshadow your well-being. Balance is key,
            and when done right, the hustle can propel you to new heights
            without burning you out.
